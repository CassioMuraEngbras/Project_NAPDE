## Finite Element Method Solver for PDEs

### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a solver for the finite element method in 1D and 2D for partial differential equations (PDEs) using the Galerkin finite element method for elliptic problems.

### Inspiration
This project is inspired by the laboratory experiment from the "Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations 2021/2022" course at Politecnico di Milano. The experiment focuses on simulations in numerical analysis.

### Implementation
The entire project is developed in Python, aiming to implement numerical methods for solving PDEs through finite element techniques. 

### Contents
The repository includes:
- Python scripts for implementing the finite element method in 1D and 2D.
- Example problems and simulations demonstrating the solver's capabilities.
  
$-\mu(x) \Delta u  + \vec{b}(x) \cdot \nabla u +\sigma(x) u= f(x), \quad  \text{in }  \Omega$

$u = g(x),\quad \text{on } \partial \Omega$

### Usage
To use the solver:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Python scripts for the desired dimension (1D or 2D) and problem setup.
4. Modify parameters or input data as needed for specific applications.
